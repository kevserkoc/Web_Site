           <li> Spas <img class="smekanresim" src="balikesir/şifa-kaplıcalalrı.jpg" alt=""> </li>
           <p>
            There are many underground resources in Balıkesir. The most important of these are thermal spas and natural water resources. Many thermal hotels, baths and hot springs are said to heal in the city and attract many visitors even from outside the city.
         </p>         
           <li> Antandros Antic City <img class="mekanresim" src="balikesir/antandros antik kenti.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            Although it has lost its historical texture, Antandros is one of the ancient cities that has managed to preserve many architectural monuments and historical parts. This ancient city, which has become one of the symbols of Balıkesir, has been one of the Episcopal centers in Christianity for many years throughout history.           </p>
           <li> Cunda Island <img class="mekanresim" src="balikesir/cunda adaso.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            This island, which you will arrive by boat in a very short time, contains architecture and culture that can give you a complete medieval atmosphere. When you arrive on this island, we recommend that you spend at least a few nights and chat with the island people in the coffee shop.           </p>
           <li>  Saatli Mosque <img class="mekanresim" src="balikesir/saatli cami.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
               
           </p>
           <li> A real Bird Sanctuary! <img class="mekanresim" src="balikesir/kuş-cenneti.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
           </p>
           <li>  Lor Baklavası <img class="mekanresim" src="lor baklavası-balikesir.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            Located in Ayvalık, this pastry shop is one of the places frequented by local people. And don't come back until you guys come here and eat curd baklava, gummy ice cream and gummy cookies! 
           </p>
           
           <li>Bigadic Casserole <img class="yemekresim" src="balıkesir yemek/balıkesir-bigadiç-güveci.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            The most basic feature that distinguishes a real bigadic casserole from other casseroles is the use of Capricorn meat. Capricorn meat combined with boiled bone broth, tomato and pepper takes its place in the Earth casserole, and the work does not end. It needs to be made in ovens that use wood embers. After spending about 2 hours in the oven, he goes out to the tables with a smell like mizler.
           </p>
           <li>Ayvalik Toast <img class="yemekresim" src="balıkesir yemek/balıkesir-ayvalık-tostu.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            Ayvalik toast is perhaps the most famous toast of our country! Although Ayvalik toast is available in cafes and fast food kiosks in almost all provinces, the original Ayvalik toast must be eaten within the borders of Balıkesir. Ayvalik toast, which is often encountered in Balıkesir, especially in Resorts, is one of the first dishes to be tried in the city.

           </p>
           <li>Rabisa <img class="yemekresim" src="balıkesir yemek/balıkesir-rabisa.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            Balıkesir in our list of local dishes, there is a pastry specific to the District of Gömeç of Balıkesir. Although not as popular as the city's famous Ravioli, this dish is loved and consumed on dinner tables. At the same time, it is one of the dishes made and offered to guests.
           </p>
           <li>Sippet <img class="yemekresim" src="balıkesir yemek/balıkesir-tirit.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            The bread is chopped in small pieces and drizzled with chicken broth. Chicken boiled in water with tomatoes in it also does not stand empty, it comes and is built on bread. When butter is added, the smell does not recognize the appetite. Finely chopped parsley is the most beautiful decoration for this taste.
           </p>
           <li>Zerde <img class="yemekresim" src="balıkesir yemek/balıkesir-zerde.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            Zerde, one of the desserts that has remained in existence since the Ottoman Empire and is still very popular, especially in Balıkesir, finds meaning with measles sugar, rose water, cloves, cinnamon and most importantly, rice, eaten with spoons. It feels like medicine to the stomachs of those who are looking for a light dessert, and not only those who are passionate about this flavor.

           </p>
           <li>Gummy Ice Cream <img class="yemekresim" src="balıkesir yemek/balıkesir-sakızlı-dondurma.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            There is a flavour that no one drops out of their hands in the summer, which they love around the clock in houses on the streets. If the unique consistency of ice cream is added to the magnificent aroma of a drop of gum, the most beautiful ice cream that can be eaten appears.
