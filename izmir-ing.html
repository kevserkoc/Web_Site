                         <li> Izmir Clock Tower <img class="mekanresim" src="izmir/izmir-saat-kulesi-4.jpg" alt=""></li>
                       <p>
                        Izmir Clock Tower, the symbol of Izmir, is an octagonal Clock Tower on an 81 square meter base and built on a marble platform in the form of a four-step Cross, 25 meters high and has four floors. The platform of the tower is made of white marble, while the other parts are made of cut stone. The fourth floor, the last floor of the tower, is of a rather narrow structure. However, this floor was destroyed by an earthquake in 1974. The bell of the clock is said to be in this section.

                        Izmir Koron, one of the most popular destinations in Izmir, is one of the places where Izmir residents go to spend a pleasant time with its azure sea view and cute cafes lined up on the edge. Izmir cordon, which has a very beautiful Sea View, hosts a peaceful atmosphere.

                        <p>
                            Boyoz, which is one of the first flavors that come to mind when it comes to Izmir, takes its place in the first place of the list of regional dishes of Izmir. Boyoz, which is not missing from the breakfast table of the people of Izmir, is the most delicious form of starting the day. It is consumed along with eggs and reflects the breakfast culture of the people of Izmir. In provinces other than Izmir, a lot of unknown boyoz is also sold in frozen form, and so those who live in other provinces can try this flavor.
                        </p>
                        <li>Izmir Tulumu <img class="yemekresim" src="izmir yemek/izmir-izmir-tulumu.jpg" alt=""></li>
                        <p>
                            Tulum cheese, which is one of the cheeses whose reputation is spread to all cities in our country, has been the sought-after flavor of breakfast tables all over our country, as in Izmir regional breakfasts. The feature of Izmir Tulum, whose other name is Shepherd's cheese, is that it is made only from sheep's milk. Although the main homeland of Izmir Tulum, which is one of the first flavors that come to mind when it comes to Izmir, is the District of Bergama, it can also be found in many places in the center of Izmir. Even this flavor, which has announced its name all over Turkey, can be found in most markets all over turkey except Izmir.

                        <li>Kumru <img class="yemekresim" src="izmir yemek/izmir-kumru.jpg" alt=""></li>
                        <p>
                            Again, we will talk about a taste that belongs to Izmir, but is known all over our country. Izmir kumru, which is the first flavor that comes to mind when it is called a sandwich all over our country, is of course eaten in Izmir in its true form. Especially in Çeşme, which is one of the most famous holiday places in our country, it has the distinction of being the most preferred food of tourists with its practicality and taste both on the beaches and on the streets.

                        <li>Stuffed Bread <img class="yemekresim" src="izmir yemek/izmir-ekmek-dolması.jpg" alt=""></li>
                        <p>
                            Perhaps one of the most original recipes of Izmir, the Pearl of the Aegean, is stuffed with bread. It's like we hear you say bread is stuffed. It would be very nice with a custom-made Bell bread. In Izmir, many bakeries make hard-shell breads to make stuffed bread. Bread stuffed with minced or kuşbaşı mortar is an indispensable dish of the feast tables of Izmir people, especially because it is fertile.

                        <li>Izmir Meatballs <img class="yemekresim" src="izmir yemek/izmir-izmir-kofte.jpg" alt=""></li>
                        <p>
                            Izmir Meatballs, which is one of the most popular dishes in all parts of our country as well as in Izmir cuisine, has become one of the most classic dishes of Turkish cuisine. But as the name suggests, this dish is identified with Izmir. This flavor, which surprises those who think that Izmir cuisine is famous only for its herb varieties, is a delicious pot dish.
                        </p>
                        <li>Lokma <img class="yemekresim" src="izmir yemek/izmir-lokma.jpeg" alt=""></li>
                        <p>
                            Lokma, which has been made since the Ottoman period and has remained popular until today, is a dessert belonging to the Izmir region. But it has become famous all over Turkey, not only in Izmir. In Izmir, when there are lokmacılar who have become chains in many cities, money is not usually given to lokmacı. For this reason, the bite is of great importance in Izmir from a social point of view.
                        </p>
                        <li>Sambali <img class="yemekresim" src="izmir yemek/izmir-şambali.jpg" alt=""></li>
                        <p>
                            Shambali, the famous street dessert of Izmir, is a great dessert sold by peddlers in every corner of Izmir. Having an important place among the local desserts of Izmir, the most beautiful Chambal is eaten in Kemeraltı Bazaar in Izmir. Although it looks like a revani in appearance, it is prepared with a wonderful combination of sweet cake and sorbet, which is understood to be different after tasting it. The cream placed between them and the Almond added on it adds flavor to the flavor.
