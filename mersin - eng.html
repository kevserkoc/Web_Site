           <li> Ancient City Of Kanlidivane <img class="mekanresim" src="mersin/mersin-kanlidivane-antik-kenti.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p> 
            Kanytella, today known as Kanlıdivane, is located in the inner part of the mountain side 3 kilometers after Eliaussa Sebaste (Ayaş). The settlement, which covers the edge of a sinkhole (about 170 X 200 meters in size), which is 60 meters deep and descended by steps carved into the rocks, was connected to the Olba Dynasty in the 2nd century BC, as the inscriptions document, and even served as the port of Olba to the sea.

            Based on the geographic similarity with the Korykon Antron (Heaven-Hell), there is a Hellenistic sanctuary inside the pothole. The tower, built of polygonal blocks on the south edge of the pothole, was built by Priest Prince Tuekros, son of Tarkyaris at the beginning of the 2nd century BC and was dedicated to Zeus Olbios.
            
            There are reliefs of the Armaronxas family on the south wall inside the pothole. The relief, located in a 4x2 meter niche, has a somewhat rough workmanship. There is a five-line inscription on the right side of the relief and the names of the family are included here. The family consists of six people, the father and mother live next to their four children. One of them is boy and three of them are girls.

           <p> 
            Adam Kayalar, estimated to have been built between the 3rd century BC and the 3rd century AD, is located in Şeytan Deresi Valley, which is about 5 kilometers from Erdemli's Kızkalesi Neighborhood. The archaeological ruin, known as Adam Kayalar and consisting of large reliefs, is one of the most important places in Mersin.

             The reliefs, estimated to have been processed in 250 years, await visitors on a valley slope that is difficult to access. There are figures of 4 women, 11 men, two children, a mountain goat and a Roman eagle in 9 niches.

           <li> Kizkalesi <img class="mekanresim" src="mersin/mersin-kizkalesi-ustten.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p> 
            Kızkalesi, located 24 kilometers east of Silifke and 60 km west of Mersin, was named after the castle on the sea with the legend told by the inhabitants of the region 85 years ago.
           
            This magnificent beauty also has a deeply affecting story.
             
            One of the kings living in Korykos prayed day and night for a baby girl. Finally, her wish was fulfilled and she had a very beautiful daughter. The king's daughter got more beautiful as she grew older. She won the admiration and love of everyone, as well as her gods, with her benevolence as well as beauty.
             
            One day, a scientist comes to the city of Korykos. The king also invites him to the palace. The king wants to know about his daughter's future. When he looks at the knowing girl, he is startled and afraid, but he does not say anything to the king. When the king forced the conscious, “My king, a snake will sting your beautiful daughter and your daughter will die. Nobody will be able to spoil this fate. You will experience the pain. "You will not be able to prevent it either."
             
            The king does not tell his daughter about this, but he is deep in thought with sadness. Finally, he built a castle on a small islet near the shore opposite Korykos Castle.
             
            He closes his beautiful daughter in this castle with his servants. The girl, unaware of what is happening, is very upset, melts away day by day, and cannot make sense of what is happening. One day the girl's soul asks for the golden yellow "Tarsus White" grape. A snake coming out of the grape basket sent from the palace bites and kills him.

           <li>Tantuni  <img class="yemekresim" src="mersin yemek/mersin-tantuni.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            Every province has a famous dish. Tantuni, which is identified with Mersin cuisine and comes to everyone's mind when it is called Mersin, is almost like the symbol of Mersin. Tantunin's reputation did not stay with Mersin, but spread all over our country. Although it is possible to find tantunici in many cities, the tantuni you eat in Mersin is another. Tantuni, which is said to come from the Arabs, is prepared by chopping the veal in small pieces and sautéing it by mixing it with spices on the sheet.
           </p>
           <li>Sıkma  <img class="yemekresim" src="mersin yemek/mersin-sıkma.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            One of the favorite flavors in Mersin, where pastries are very common, is sıkma. Although there are discussions about which region belongs to the sıkma made in the surrounding provinces, you can definitely eat the best in Mersin. Sıkma, a snack of Yoruk origin, is cooked in sheet metal and consumed hot. Sıkma, which is indispensable for Yoruk breakfasts, is a very popular flavor in Mersin.
           </p>
           <li> Hummus <img class="yemekresim" src="mersin yemek/mersin-humus.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            Originally unique to the Tarsus district of Mersin, this very special flavor is loved and consumed in many parts of our country. Hummus is usually served as a cold appetizer in other regions, while in Mersin it takes its place on tables as a hot meal. Hummus, a very famous food in Tarsus, is at the top of the menus in many restaurants in the region. It is known that sour tastes are very popular in Mersin, where citrus fruits are abundant. A lot of lemon is also used in Tarsus hummus, which exactly appeals to the taste of sour lovers.  
           </p>
           <li>Silifke Yoghurt  <img class="yemekresim" src="mersin yemek/mersin-silifke-yogurdu.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            Silifke yoghurt, which is the subject of folk songs, is one of the Branded Foods of Mersin. Its reputation is not only with Silifke, but also with its flavor and consistency, which makes Silifke yogurt, which is the most famous yogurt in our country, famous. It gets its flavor from the milk of goats grazing in the natural vegetation of the Taurus Mountains, and its consistency from the techniques of Silifkeli women who have fermented this yogurt for centuries.
           </p>
           <li>Kerebiç  <img class="yemekresim" src="mersin yemek/mersin-kerebic.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            When it is called Mersin, people think of tantuni first. And then Kerebiç. This favorite dessert of Mersin goes very well next to tea after tantuninin. Although güllaç is known as Ramadan dessert in Turkey, Mersin's Ramadan dessert is Kerebiç. The inside of the cookie prepared with semolina is filled with pistachios or walnuts according to preference and served with foam obtained from mixing the pot with sugar, which gives this dessert its property.
           </p>
           <li>Cezerye  <img class="yemekresim" src="mersin yemek/mersin-cezerye.jpg" alt=""></li>
           <p>
            Another reason for the rivalry between Mersin and Adana is Cezerye. It is debated whether Mersin cezeri is sweeter or Adana cezeri is the first food cezerye that those who leave both cities take with them. It is noted for being sweet spicy, with carrots in the lead role. Spices such as clove, turmeric, cinnamon, ginger are added to the carrot, which is a must for cezerye .
